# Embedded Caffe

&emsp;&emsp;Make the depth learning model run on Embedded Systems.

# Target and Features

- Based on [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)
- Compactï¼ŒOnly forward calculation
- Including the mainstream algorithm, like faster rcnn, ssd, and so on.
- Support GPU/CPU model
- Cross-platform

# Build
